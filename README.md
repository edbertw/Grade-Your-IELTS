## Results & Method
```
R2 Score of Linear Regression = 0.16
R2 Score of SVR = 0.23
R2 Score of Random Forest = 0.25
R2 Score of BERT + untrained head = 0.3063
MAE of BERT + untrained head = 0.694
R2 Score of fine-tuned DistilBERT = 0.491
MAE of fine-tuned DistilBERT = 0.514
R2 Score of fine-tuned RoBERTa = ?? (Require further evaluation)
MAE of fine-tuned RoBERTa = ?? (Require further evaluation)
```
Fine-Tuned DistilBERT is best performing.

## Future work
Fine-tuning BERT base uncased (may be computationally expensive)

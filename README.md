# Grade IELTS with NLP and Machine Learning Algorithms
## About
This algorithm is trained on a dataset consisting of Essays and Overall IELTS Score for writing. It employs a TfidfVectorizer text feature extraction algorithm to convert text to numerical vector representation (Tokenization) which can be used as features for the machine learning algorithm. I tested the feature X and target y on three separate powerful Regression algorithms to see which performs best. The Random Forest Regressor performs well, with a score of 25%, when predicting IELTS Writing Scores. Note that due to the nature of this task, it is difficult to predict the score accurately with standard Machine Learning algorithms. I then deployed this algorithm to a web application using the streamlit library, so that users may input their essays in an interactive interface and environment.
## Run Instructions
On the command line, use the command ```python3 main.py``` ,then use the command ```streamlit run main.py``` to start grading your IELTS Essay.
